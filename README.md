Problem 1 (50 points)

Develop a code that run linear regression with gradient decent algorithm for each of the explanatory variables in isolation. In this case, you assume that in each iteration, only one explanatory variable (either X1, or X2, or X3) is explaining the output. Basically, you need to do three different training, one per each explanatory variable. For the learning rate, explore different values between 0.1 and 0.01 (your choice). Initialize your parameters to zero (theta to zero).


Problem 2 (50 points)

This time, run linear regression with gradient descent algorithm using all three explanatory variables. For the learning rate, explore different values between 0.1 and 0.01 (your choice). Initialize your parameters (theta to zero).
